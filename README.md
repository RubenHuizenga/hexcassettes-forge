# Hexcassettes Forge

Unofficial Forge port for [Hexcassettes](https://modrinth.com/mod/hexcassettes). Credits go to [miyucomics](https://modrinth.com/user/miyucomics) for the original mod.

A Hexcasting addon for all your delaying and daemon needs! This addon adds cassettes, which enable you to schedule Hexes to run after a set delay. Each cassette allows for one Hex and if you are clever about it, you can quine it so it acts as completely independent casting.
